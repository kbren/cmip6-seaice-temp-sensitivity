#### Motivation:
The state of global sea ice is strongly related to changes in the mean temperature. This is in part a result of the sea ice-albedo feedback, which amplities ice loss with increases in Arctic air temperature. 
Various studies have shown that Arctic sea ice loss is underestimated when compared to observations in previous CMIPs (i.e. Stroeve et al., 2012). It's unclear if this is due to differences in Arctic warming or differences in the sensitivity of sea ice concentrations to warming.

#### Goals:
Here we aim to quantify the senstivity between Arctic surface air temperature and sea ice across different models. We want to investigate: how strong is this relationship, what is the seasonal variation in the relationship, and how much variability is there across models. 

### Where is our analysis so far?

Most of our results so far are in a combined notebook in the following location:
